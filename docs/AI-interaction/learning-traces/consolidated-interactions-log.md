# Consolidated AI Interaction Log

This log documents all major AI agent interactions, user goals, decisions, implemented changes, and learnings during the current project cycle.

## Interaction 1: Codebase Restructuring, Refactoring, and Security Hardening

- **Date**: June 2026
- **User Goal**: Complete all outstanding tasks in `.TODO/todo-next.md` to consolidate structure, remove duplicate logic, and harden MCP security.
- **Current Product State**: Functional but with significant route and parser duplication, and lacking rate limiting and token-auth in MCP.
- **Implemented Changes & Decisions**:
  1. **Route Restructuring**: Moved all public pages to `src/app/(public)/` and dashboard pages to `src/app/(auth)/app/` to leverage Next.js Route Groups.
  2. **Auth Guard Consolidation**: Relocated auth guards from middleware to `src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx` and removed middleware redirections, dramatically speeding up public page requests.
  3. **CSV Parsing Consolidation**: Replaced four redundant inline CSV splitting/manual parsers in actions and handlers with a unified `parseCSVString` call (backed by PapaParse in `csvLoader.ts`).
  4. **Clean Numeric Parsing**: Extracted hardcoded currency symbols, date patterns, and `cleanNumericValue` helpers into `src/lib/utils/number-parser.ts` and imported them back in cleaner and preview-generator.
  5. **API Upload Route Unification**: Delegated `/api/upload/route.ts` directly to the canonical server action `uploadCSV`, shrinking the route file from 629 lines to 30 lines.
  6. **Security Hardening**:
     - Added Content-Security-Policy dynamic nonce generation inside `middleware.ts`.
     - Added secure API Key and permission validation to the public AI endpoint (`/api/public/ai/route.ts`).
     - Added strict rate limiting (50/min), audit logging, and `x-mcp-service-token` / `x-mcp-admin-token` client authentication to the MCP endpoint (`/api/mcp/route.ts`).
- **Problems Marked**:
  - `blocker`: Stale type caches under `.next/types/` threw compile errors after folder movement. Fixed by purging `.next/` cache.
  - `risk`: Unused imports and variables triggered linter warnings. Fixed by cleaning up `oauthAccount`, `redirect`, and other variables.
  - `improvement`: Manual CSV parsing couldn't handle edge cases like commas inside quotes. Consolidating into `csvLoader` completely resolved this.
- **User Learning**: Route groups in Next.js allow clean layout scoping and simplify middleware, maintaining security with excellent performance.
- **AI-Agent Learning**: Standardizing shared utilities (like `Result` and `parseCSVString`) before rewriting routes ensures structural stability and fast, error-free refactoring.

## Interaction 2: GitHub Actions Workflow Speed Optimization

- **Date**: June 2026
- **User Goal**: Optimize GitHub Actions workflows for speed, reliability, and concurrency, preserving existing Railway deploy logic.
- **Current Product State**: Workflows lacked pnpm dependency caching, concurrency controls, or path-based filtering, leading to duplicate runs and slower build times.
- **Implemented Changes & Decisions**:
  1. **Concurrency Groups**: Added `concurrency` cancelling to `ci.yml` to automatically cancel stale runs on new pushes.
  2. **Path Filtering**: Added `paths-ignore` for `docs/**`, `.TODO/**`, `*.md`, etc., to prevent triggering expensive build/deploy actions when only docs or todo files are changed.
  3. **Dependency Caching**: Enabled `cache: "pnpm"` on all `actions/setup-node@v6` steps across validation and maintenance workflows, greatly speeding up `pnpm install` execution times.
- **Problems Marked**:
  - `improvement`: Redundant validation or building steps could be avoided by caching node dependencies.
- **User Learning**: Concurrency and path ignore filters save significant CI minutes and prevent race conditions.
- **AI-Agent Learning**: Always check for dependency caching options when working with setups like `actions/setup-node`.
