## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Simplify display controls to a compact Light Mode, Dark Mode, and zoom menu with dark mode as the default.
- Show Business and Accountancy onboarding badges in the sidebar so users can see required setup steps, completion progress, and completed status before starting analysis.
- Redesign Account settings as a wider control center with Profile, Company, Subscription, Security, setup progress, account status, completion indicators, and a Continue Setup action.
- Expand Business Profile setup into a professional multi-step wizard that collects tax, payroll, insurance, fixed-cost, margin, cash-reserve, and growth assumptions for more accurate uploaded-data analysis.
- Show Accountancy as a pre-bookkeeping center for new users with document upload, package generation, export, accountant email, and Business Profile context guidance instead of an unavailable state.
- Show Retail Inventory Analyst results in scrollable tables with every matching product row, SKU, stock, sales, profit, margin, last-sale, and owner action details so store owners can decide what to reorder, discount, bundle, or protect.

### Fixed

- Show plan price and a secure checkout button in the Upgrade to Pro modal, then start Stripe Checkout directly with a visible error if payment setup fails.
- Center billing review panel to prevent sidebar squeezing on Account/Settings page
- Fix Retail Inventory Analyst build by using a browser-safe CSV parser in the client component
